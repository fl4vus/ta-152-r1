"You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles"

(Like a Sword Over Damocles - Trivium)
