## TA-152-R1 Cipher (Original Implementation)
TA-152-R1 is a unique implentation of my [TA-152-R0](https://github.com/fl4vus/ta-152-r0 "TA-152-R0") cipher, and implements IV for better key non-determinism.

TA-152-R1 passes a complete functional regression test suite _(test.sh)_, including determinism, IV-based non-determinism, key sensitivity, binary safety, and wrong-key robustness.
The project currently has **EXPERIMENTAL** stability, and is not suitable for production cryptography.
